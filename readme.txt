Supervisor is a plugin to help improve the performance and security of your WordPress install.

== Description ==

[Supervisor](https://supervisorwp.com) is a plugin to help improve the performance and security of your WordPress install.

It detects some useful information regarding your site's health and then displays them conveniently via the WordPress Dashboard.

This plugin can help you improve your site performance by cleaning up the transients and deactivating autoload options.

Supervisor also verifies the software versions in use by your server.

Besides that, Supervisor also checks for your SSL certificate expiration date and notifies you via Dashboard when it is near expiration or expired.
