Supervisor is a plugin to help improve the performance of your WordPress site.

== Description ==

[Supervisor](https://supervisorwp.com) is a plugin to help improve the performance of your WordPress site.

It detects some useful information regarding your site health, like the number of active transients and autoload options, and then displays them conveniently via the WordPress Dashboard.

This plugin can help you improve your site performance by cleaning up the transients and deactivating autoload options.

Supervisor also verifies the software versions in use by your server.

SSL certificate expiration dates are also checked and notifications for expired or near expiration SSL certificates are provided conveniently via the WordPress Dashboard.
