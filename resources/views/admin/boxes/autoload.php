<h3>Autoload Options</h3>

<div>
	<p>WordPress autoload options are very similar to transients. The main difference is: transients are used to store temporary data, while options are used to store permanent data.</p>
	<p>All the autoload options, as well as transients, are loaded automatically when WordPress loads itself. Thus, the number and size of these options can directly affect your site performance.</p>
