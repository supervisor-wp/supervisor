		<p>WordPress transients are used to temporarily cache specific data. For example, developers often use them to improve their themes and plugins performance by caching database queries and script results.</p>
		<p>However, some badly coded plugins and themes can store too much information on these transients, or can even create an excessively high number of transients, resulting in performance degradation.</p>
